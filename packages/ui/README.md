# agribank UI package built with react and MUI

Includes bunch of components to facilitate building UI apps for agribank. Note that you MUST use the components exported from here
instead of importing the directly from `mui` (if their counter part exists).

# Notes

This expects the consumer to have a build process, this package does NOT bundle css files.

TODO:

1. move stuff out of assets and into public, all fonts/images are getting inlined!
